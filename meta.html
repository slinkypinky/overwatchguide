      <h2>Tanks</h2>
      <div class="tank">
        Tanks have recently got many changes to them while trying to nerf
        shields. As shields got weaker, the off-tanks got stronger. Without
        question, the strongest off-tank hero right now is Zarya. Normally, with
        an off tank you would go a main tank, but thats not the case since
        shields have been nerfed. The second strongest tank right now is
        currently Roadhog. His hook combo now got buffed, making targets come
        0.5m closer to him, making it easier to shoot a hero in the head, which
        will one shot them easier.

        <h2>DPS</h2>
        Soldier is currently getting a big buff next patch, which will give him
        a super easy recoil to control and they removed the random bullet
        spread, and give him 30 ammo. This means his shots will line up
        perfectly on a row, and all you have to do is to drag ur mouse down
        while shooting and all ur shots will hit. He is definetely a S tier
        pick. The other good right now is Widowmaker. She is a sniper which
        means that she can't get killed easily because she can camp from afar,
        and pick off targets easily, without any pressure. However, widowmaker
        is high risk high reward, because if you dont hit your shots, you will
        just throw the game.
